        <i>"Magic works differently there"--Pat</i>     
        <i>"there is no royalty older than the Modegan royal line"</i>
        We know nothing about their currency aside from the word “strehlaums”. 
        There is no Modegan campfire in Sceop’s story, and the only stereotype we get from there is that they’re quite promiscuous. 
        <br>
        We dont know much about Modeg, but weve gotten glimpses of their religion. <b>Fela and Sovoy</b> are both Modegan. Fela says "tiny gods" and Sovoy (and Bredon) says "gods all around us." IRL there was a playing card that Pat shared of the Modegan <b>"hollow gods"</b> which featured a tree with eyes. Also in the prologue of <b>*Laniel Young-Again </b> that he shared there are "tall gods" and describes the god as a tree with branches reaching to they sky. <br>Note: Tall is a homophone of "Tahl" (the nomadic people) and its been theorized that those meanings have been mixed in various stories.
        <br> From other cards we know "Cimbrel House" which is where Cimbrelines work - the official name for the Modegan "ladies" who earn their stripes. They literally have an education that allows them to earn up to ten stripes.
        <br> From the Tak Companion Book:
        <i>
        there are several accounts in which a player’s piece finds itself off the board, on the floor, and most famously in the cleavage of a high ranking Modegan Cimbreline. (page 34)

    'Ceald': `<p>  
        <b>Language:</b> Siaru <br>
        Its history stretches back two thousand years, to when Heldred united the previously nomadic peoples of the Shalda mountains. 
        The Cealdim were the first to establish a standardized currency, and to the present day Cealdish currency can be used throughout the Four Corners. 
        <i>"...most moneylenders are Cealdish</i>
        Cealdim is composed of two groups, the Cealdim and Cealdar. 
        The Cealdim appear to be the richer merchant class and money-lenders. The Cealdar were made of the workers in the workshops. 
        The groups got their names from the original founder of the country.
        The nomadic folk who roamed the Shalda mountains were united under Heldred who had two sons Heldim and Heldar. 
        <br>Wilem is Cealdish.
        <br><b>Curency:</b><br>
        <i>We presume that the earliest money was made literally by sawing slices from ingots of metal. In more recent times they are no longer made in this way, but retain the same shape through custom and tradition. It features a simple stamp of a <b>mountain and lake, the symbol of Ceald</b>.

        <i>Either way, this chaos is what eventually led to the Quiat Auriam. The treaty that gave the Cealdish government the exclusive right to loan and exchange gold coinage. A right they defend fiercely even to this day.(from 10th anniversary edition)

    'Vintas': `<p>
        <b>Language:</b> Eld Vintic (before Great Aturan Empire) <br>
        Vintas has its own currency, which is used in the Waystone Inn in the present and has interesting 
        <a href=" https://worldbuildersmarket.com/products/king-feyda-calanthis-breakable-vintish-penny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lore</a>
         associated. Some of its coins can be broken apart and others have a specific thickness with gold wire in the groove <br>
        In Vintas, the nobility have more privilege than in the more egalitarian Commonwealth. <br>
        Ambrose's Father, is currently 12th in line for the Vintic throne at the end of Wise Man’s Fear. 

        <br><b>History:</b> <b>Feyda Calanthis</b> was posthumously declared the first king of <b>Tarvintas</b> (later <b>Vintas</b>), founding the royal <b>Calanthis line</b>.
          
        <br><b>Religion:</b>
            <i>“How about off in Vintas?” Ben asked. <b>“Fair number of them are Tehlins</b>. Do they feel the same way?”
                My mother shook her head. “They think it’s a little silly. They like their demons metaphorical.”
                “What are they afraid of at night in Vintas then?”
            <b> “The Fae,”</b> my mother said.
                My father spoke at the same time. <b>“Draugar.”</b>
                “You’re both right, depending on which part of the country you’re in,” Ben said. (NotW, Ch. 12)
            </i>

            <i>They thought he was a <b>barrow draug</b>, you see, one of the unquiet dead that superstitious Vints believe walk the night.

            </i>

            Tehlin religion exists within Vintas as a result of the expansion of the Aturan empire. 
            <i> Count Threpe: "back before the empire stomped in, converting everyone to the iron law and the Book of the Path." (WMF, Ch. 50) </i>
            This puts the rumor that Bredon engages in "pagan rituals" (WMF, Ch. 74) within a new context, as it stands to reason that at least some portions of the Vintish population are "pagans" from a Tehlin standpoint (it could also be that the Menda heresy is more prevelant in Vintas,
            see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/uk0ei9/martens_prayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Marten's prayers</a>  in WMF, Ch. 91). 
            
            <br><b>Rings:</b>
            <i>For time out of mind, the Vintish people have given rings to indicate promises, debts, or an exchange of favors. While originally a folk tradition, these days the practice is more common among the nobility, who use the rings as status symbols and calling cards.

    'Renere': `<p> Renere is called the three-part city - because three prince regents hold power over various parts of the city.
            <i>
            The royal court in Renere was busy too. The Prince Regent Alaitis had been killed in a duel, sending much of the southern farrel into chaos as various nobility did their best to capitalize on the death of such a highly ranked member of the court. (WMF, Ch. 137) 
            </i>
            Kvothe is supposed to visit Renere in the 3rd book.
            </p>`,
    'Yll': `<p>
            <b>Language:</b> Yllish (before Great Aturan Empire) <br>
            Yll seems to be a <b>sheep-farming economy</b>, and not regarded very highly by the 4 corners, possibly as consequence of it´s colonization by the Great Aturan Empire. 
            This is interesting considering it has a rich culture, its own calendar and earliest known writing system, which are usually considered signs of "civilization".
            <br>
            Denna mentions that Yll has a <b>milder climate</b> (it's the first winter where her lungs have not acted up).
            The Yllish <b>knot language</b> appears (or could) have magical properties that Denna uses in the form of braids.
            Viari also mistakes Kvothe for being Yllish because of his <b>red hair</b>.
            <br>
            Some theories associate Yll with names like Illien (the famous Edena composer) or Murilla (the old city).
            <i>"I had heard that Yllish tribes use the sun to tell time, and as such, have no true concept of punctuality."</i>
            <i>"For tomorrow, you can prepare a report on Yll’s lunar calendar compared to the more accurate, civilized Aturan calendar that you should be familiar with by now."</i>
            <i>“The Yllish people never developed a written language,” she said.
            “Not true,” Elodin said. “They used a system of woven knots.” He made a complex motion with his hands, as if braiding something.<br>
            “And they were doing it long before we started scratching pictograms on the skins of sheep.” - WMF, Chapter 15</i>
            <i> Yllish shared nothing with Aturan or Shaldish, or even with Ademic for that matter. It was an irrational, tangled mess. Fourteen indicative verb tenses. Bizarre formal inflections of address.
            You couldn’t merely say “the Chancellor’s socks.” Oh no. Too simple. All ownership was oddly dual: as if the Chancellor owned his socks, but at the same time the socks somehow also gained ownership of the Chancellor. This altered the use of both words in complex grammatical ways. As if the simple act of owning socks somehow fundamentally changed the nature of a person.</i>
            From the Tak Companion Book:
            <i>"the game of Trio was first described in the journal of the infamous Yllish explorer Farau Lyari (page 14)"</i> 
            Note: the ficional author of the book insults Yll people several times in the text.
            <i>The cost of a bottle of fine Yllish wine might be considered an investment against future winnings as you attempt to blur your opponent’s wits with drink. </i>
            </p>`,
    'The Aturan Empire': `<p> <b>Language:</b> Aturan (most spoken in the 4 corners) <br>
         Note the other territories in the same color known as "Ciradats". <br>
         The Tehlin church is particularly powerful there, and probably originated in Atur: according to church teachings, 
         Atur is where Tehlu bound Encanis to the wheel. Present day Aturans are seen as superstitious. 
         Many of their dramatic works are morality plays about bargaining with demons, or dramas featuring sinister magicians.
         <br>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/1x3llo/faq_the_appendix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Aturan calendar</a>  is the most widely used in the books.
         
        <br><b>Currency:</b><br><i>
        “Arturan currency has the dubious distinction of having the only two commonly circulated coins that are not recognized 
        by the Quait Auriam, and therefor not accepted by the Cealdish moneylenders.” (10 anniversary edition, page 722).</i>
        Fun fact, their coin "Penance piece"is not a currency in a conventional sense. It’s produce by the church and not even exchangeable for other currency. Though is accepted all through Atur in churches for a pauper’s loaf of bread about the size of a grown man’s fist.
         
        From the Tak Companion Book:
        <i>
        In most of Atur, asking “trouper rules?” is a small courtesy intended to prevent misunderstandings.
        </i>
        
        </p>`,

    'Commonwealth': `<p> <b>Language:</b> Aturan <br> 
        <b>Currency:</b><br>
        <i>..."each major city and province in the commonwealth has the right to strike its own coinage. And while there is a set of standards for the currency, these riles are frequently bent and broken. The result is that different cities use slightly different weights and purities for their coinage.” (10 anniversary edition pg 719).
        Not a huge issue in smaller places (baronies or towns) because they praise their own coins with civic pride. But the further you get from the source of the coin, the less people trust them. “…it’s for that reason that most of the buisness dealings at the university (and all over the world) happen in good, solid, reliable Cealdish coin”. (719).</i>

Vashet spent four years as a captain and bodyguard to a \"poet king\" in the Small Kingdoms. Caudicus claimed that a large portion of the land which is now the Small Kingdoms was once ruled by the Lackless family. (Possibly north of Tinue) </p>",    // Major Cities
    'The Free City of Tinue': 
        `<p> It was once part of an earldom controlled by the <b>Lackless family</b>, until a rebellion took control of the city away from them. <br> It is a common Aturan expression to ask "how is the road to Tinuë?"
        , and it\'s believed that all the roads in the Four Corners will eventually pass through the city. 
        <br> It might be <b>Tinusa</b>, the city that survived the Creation War. </p>`,
    'Atur': 
        `<p> Atur is marked as a notable city, but not a government seat. 
        <i>in Felior´s Fall there are a full thirteen (Chandrian): one for each pontifet in Atur, and an extra for the capitol.</i> About the Lackless family> <i>In Atur they became the Lack-key family.

        `<p> <i>(Tell them )“I was a city-licensed escort from Ralien. A grateful Cealdish merchant gave me money to start an inn. His name is Deolan. We were traveling from Purvis.”</i> Ralien is the capital city of Ceald. Wilem is from Ralien, where his family are wool merchants. <br> Marten mentions that, three weeks before they had begun working with Kvothe, they had finished a caravan job from Ralien. </p>`,
    'Anilin': `<p>

        <i>“You could come to Anilin with us,” she suggested. “They say the streets are paved with gold there."</i> Probably a industrial city, see the connection with the chemical compound "Aniline" (used for hairdyes and fuel that burns blue) and is in route for Kvothe when he describes: <i>"Eventually we came to another stream crossing the road. Not much more than a foot deep at the most. The water had a sharp, foul smell that let me know there was a tannery upstream, or a refinery (...) Solvents and acids. If not a refinery, then at least a mine."</i> Other mentions:<br><i>“The fire was blue last night?” She nodded. “Like a coal-gas flame. Like the lamps they have in Anil<strong>e</strong>n.”</i> <i>“What happened in Anilin, anyway?” A leaf floated down and landed in her hair.

    "Ademre": `<p> 
        <b>Language:</b>Ademic and Adem sign language <br> 
        The foundation of the Adem culture is a belief system called the Lethani, which informs everything the Adem do. Ademre is well known for producing capable fighters known as Adem mercenaries or <strong>Cethan</strong> who wear bright red tight-fitting clothing. <br> Ademre is outside the 4 corners. 
        They probably have their own studies in Naming, see Magwyn
        From the Tak Companion Book:
        <i> some of Tak’s earliest origins come from Ademre in the strategy game Locke (or Llean). As a result, while most Adem are aware of
        Tak, many see the added complexity as unnecessary, and consider it a “barbarian’s game.” (page 37)
        </i>
        <i>

        </i>
        <i>

   'The Barrens': `<p> “The Barrens” name is not meant to describe a desolate place—it  originally referred to shifting baronies (“where the barons are”), but a cartographer’s
        mistake turned it into a misleading name. 
        <i> "I put wrong things in maps because cartographers screw up. I put translation errors in maps because, like. But like no one will ever know. There's  a section in one of the maps. And it's called 'The Barrens'. And it's like, “Well, obviously this a desolate place.” No, it's because many many years ago there were a bunch of baronies that fought. Um. And then a cartographer was like, “Man! This is changing all the time; they’re always fighting. This is just... ‘where the barons are’.” And so now, it's like, “Oh, this idiot misspelled Barrens,” and NOW everyone’s like, “Well, I don’t wanna live in the barrens, and that's the name of the region.” And this is a little joke just for me. -Pat "

    'Vesumbi Islands': `<p> In the Aturan Empire map the spelling is "V Sumbi Isles". Vi Sembi raiders are known to attack towns with flint and obsidian arrows. It\'s possible that they\'re from the Vesumbi Islands.</p>`,

    'Stormwal': `<p>When Kvothe visited the Cthaeh, he was told that he wouldn't have a hope of his search for the Chandrian being taken seriously until he made it to Stormwal. This persuaded Kvothe to go with Tempi back to Ademre. <br> He described the land at the foot of the Stormwal as <i>rocky and jagged, with a narrow road that snaked back and forth to avoid box valleys, bluffs, and jumbles of broken rock.</i> The air in the Stormwal is thin and cool  <br>In NotW they are mentioned, possibly in relation to Tahlenwald (see above, to the east):<i>“I want to hear about the dry lands over the Stormwal,” one of the younger girls complained. “About the sand snakes that come out of the ground like sharks.

        </i>
        Tarbean is divided into two: Waterside (the poorer side, closer to the coast) and Hillside (the richer side).<br>
        The known districts of Tarbean are: Downings, Drover Court, the Wash, Middletown, Tallows, Tunning, Dockside, the Tarway and Seamline Lane.
        <br>From the Tak Companion Book:
