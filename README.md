# Kingkiller-fanmade-interactive-map
A fanmade, interactive map of the world from The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. This image map lets you click through different locations from the books and discover details about them. It uses as a base the poster map sold by Worldbuilders on their website, since it is the most complete version.
